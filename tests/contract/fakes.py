"""Fake `LLMPort` implementation + shared contract-test types.

`FakeLLMAdapter` is a canned-response stand-in for the real adapters.
It ships no SDK dependency: every `generate()` call is answered
directly from memory, controlled by a `FakeMode` field the test can
flip between calls. Purpose is two-fold:

  * a control group for the parametrized contract tests --- if a real
    adapter fails a contract test that the fake passes, the divergence
    is in the adapter's translation logic, not in the test;
  * a drop-in `LLMPort` for higher-level tests (e.g. `FallbackModel`)
    that need deterministic tier / error behaviour without SDK fakery.

`AdapterSpec` lives here rather than in `conftest.py` so it can be
imported by both the conftest wiring and the contract test module
without cross-conftest imports. Keeping the type in a plain module
sidesteps pytest's conftest-discovery magic.
