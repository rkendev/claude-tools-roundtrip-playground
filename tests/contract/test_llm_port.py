"""Parametrized contract tests for every `LLMPort` implementation.

Proves the UNIFORM shape of the port across every adapter we ship:

  * `isinstance(adapter, LLMPort)` is structurally true for all of them
  * the healthy path returns an `LLMResponse` whose `tier` matches what
    the adapter declares (so `FallbackModel` can trust the tier field
    for observability)
  * empty / whitespace prompts raise `ValueError` or
    `LLMPermanentError` --- both are permitted by the `LLMPort`
    docstring, and the contract suite is agnostic about which one a
    given adapter picks
  * every SDK-level failure translates to exactly one of the three
    domain error classes: `LLMTransientError` (recoverable -->
    next tier), `LLMPermanentError` (don't retry), or
    `LLMContentError` (call succeeded but the content is unusable).
    No vendor SDK exception is allowed to escape.

The per-adapter unit tests
(`tests/unit/infrastructure/test_*_adapter.py`) still cover the
exhaustive per-vendor error-translation truth tables (5xx vs 4xx,
rate limit vs auth vs not-found, etc.) The contract suite is the
drift detector: if some future adapter edit breaks the `LLMPort`
contract, the matching contract test fails for that adapter while the
fake keeps passing --- and the failure pattern immediately points at
the adapter rather than the test scaffolding.

Parametrization is driven by `LLM_ADAPTERS` in `conftest.py`. Adding
another adapter is a one-entry change in that list and the whole test
grid runs against it automatically. Today's grid is
8 contract tests * 4 adapters = 32 test cases.
