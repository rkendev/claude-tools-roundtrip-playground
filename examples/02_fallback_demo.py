"""Example 02 — full three-tier FallbackModel via the composition root.

Uses `build_llm(settings)` to assemble whichever tiers have their
preconditions met: cloud tiers only if their API key is set, local
Ollama always appended. The `LLMResponse.tier` field on the returned
value tells you which tier actually served the request — critical for
production observability.

Run from the repository root:

    uv run python examples/02_fallback_demo.py

Exits 0 on any successful completion (regardless of which tier served
it). Exits 2 on an unrecoverable error after logging which tier raised.

To actually see a tier hop, temporarily break the primary tier
(e.g. `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-wrong` to force a 401, or point
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` at an unknown model) and re-run — the response will
come back tagged with `tier=secondary` or `tier=tertiary` depending on
what else is configured.
