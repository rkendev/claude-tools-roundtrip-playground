"""FallbackModel: tier-based orchestration across multiple LLMPort adapters.

This is the behavioural core of the three-tier strategy (Claude Haiku ->
gpt-4o-mini -> Ollama). `FallbackModel` itself implements the `LLMPort`
protocol, so callers can swap it in wherever a single adapter would go.

Failure routing (see docs/DECISIONS.md D2 for rationale):

- `LLMTransientError` -> log at WARNING, advance to the next tier.
- `LLMPermanentError` -> log at ERROR, re-raise immediately. Falling over
  would not help (auth / request shape is wrong everywhere) and would mask
  a configuration bug.
- `LLMContentError` -> log at ERROR, re-raise immediately. The same prompt
  will likely trigger the same refusal on the next tier; swallowing it
  would violate the observability contract.
- All tiers exhausted with transient errors -> raise a final
  `LLMTransientError` chained (`raise ... from last`) to preserve the root
  cause for log correlation.

Logging uses a bound `structlog` logger with `tier_index` (0-based position
in the composition list) and `tier_class` (the adapter class name). The
semantic tier label (`LLMTier.PRIMARY` etc.) comes from the adapter's
returned `LLMResponse.tier` and is NOT assumed to match position, so a
caller can reorder adapters without breaking observability.
