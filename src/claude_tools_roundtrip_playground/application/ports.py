"""Port protocols for the application layer.

A port is a contract: infrastructure adapters implement it, application
orchestrators consume it. Using `typing.Protocol` (PEP 544) over an abstract
base class keeps the domain free of inheritance coupling to application code
and lets adapters conform structurally without importing this module.

See SPECIFICATION.md section 2.2 and docs/DECISIONS.md D1 (protocol-not-ABC).

    Adapters translate this signature into their SDK-specific call
    (`anthropic.messages.create`, `openai.chat.completions.create`,
    `ollama.chat`) and always return a domain `LLMResponse`. On failure
    they raise one of the three subclasses in `domain.errors` --- never
    an SDK-native exception. This is what lets `FallbackModel` route
    transient failures to the next tier without knowing anything about
    which vendor raised the error.

    `@runtime_checkable` enables `isinstance(obj, LLMPort)` for tests and
    defensive composition, but note that runtime checks only verify method
    *presence*, not signature --- mypy remains the primary contract
    enforcer.

        Parameters
        ----------
        prompt:
            User-facing prompt text. Must be non-empty. Empty prompts are a
            programming error; adapters may raise `ValueError` or an
            `LLMPermanentError` subclass.
        system:
            Optional system prompt. Adapters whose underlying model does
            not natively accept a system role (some Ollama models) should
            prepend this to the prompt before dispatching.
        max_tokens:
            Upper bound on generated tokens. `None` means the adapter's
            default (which each adapter documents in its module docstring).
        temperature:
            Sampling temperature in `[0.0, 2.0]`. `None` means adapter
            default. Validation of the range is the adapter's
            responsibility; the port intentionally does not constrain it.

        Returns
        -------
        LLMResponse
            Frozen domain response carrying `text`, `tier`, token counts,
            `latency_ms`, and tz-aware `created_at`.

        Raises
        ------
        LLMTransientError
            Recoverable upstream failure --- safe to fail over to the next
            tier. Examples: HTTP 429, 5xx, network timeout.
        LLMPermanentError
            Unrecoverable --- do not retry, do not fail over. Examples:
            HTTP 4xx (auth, bad request), unknown model string.
        LLMContentError
            Call succeeded but returned unusable content (empty body,
            policy refusal, malformed tool-call payload).
