"""Composition root.

This is the only module allowed to import across all three architectural
layers: `domain`, `application`, and `infrastructure`. Every other module
observes the dependency rule (domain knows nothing, application depends
on domain, infrastructure depends on domain + application). Centralising
the cross-layer wiring here keeps the rest of the codebase testable in
isolation.

Wiring is driven by `Settings.llm_tier`:

- `"primary"` / `"secondary"` / `"tertiary"` return a single adapter
  directly, bypassing fail-over. This matches the contract documented
  in `.env.example` --- use a single tier when the caller wants
  diagnostic transparency (no retries, no tier hop) rather than
  resilience.
- `"fallback"` wraps every available tier in `FallbackModel` for the
  full transient-failure-to-next-tier behaviour (see D2). Cloud-hosted
  adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI) are skipped when their API key is
  absent --- a partial environment (e.g. only an Anthropic key) still
  gets a working fallback rather than failing loudly. Ollama is local
  and has no credentials, so it is always appended; if the daemon
  isn't running, the call surfaces as an `LLMTransientError` at the
  tail of the cascade instead of at construction time.

Scope today: T007a, T008, and T009 shipped all three adapters.
`"primary"` -> Claude Haiku. `"secondary"` -> gpt-4o-mini.
`"tertiary"` -> local Ollama. `"fallback"` composes every tier whose
preconditions are met: the cloud tiers when keys are set, plus Ollama
unconditionally as the always-free last-resort.
