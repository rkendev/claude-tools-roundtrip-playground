# Brings up the default compose stack (Ollama only), waits for its
# healthcheck to clear, hits the /api/tags endpoint to prove the HTTP
# server is serving, then tears everything down. Exits non-zero with a
# clear message at whichever step fails — callers (CI, Makefile, or a
# local developer) can use the exit code directly without parsing output.
#
# Usage:    ./scripts/smoke.sh
# Requires: docker + docker compose v2 (the `docker compose` subcommand,
#           not the legacy `docker-compose` binary).
